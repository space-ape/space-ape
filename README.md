- 👋 Hi, I’m @space-ape
- 👀 I’m interested in computational mathematics: optimizaing NP-hard problems to near-optimality
- 🌱 I’m currently learning quantum computing, machine learning, with some programming languages: c++, julia
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making tutorials on solving financial problems and decision making.
- 📫 How to reach me: throw me a banana or a kiwi.
